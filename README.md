Hi!

This asset pack was made by Henry Chandler as part of the Meritite Union.

Input Prompts is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal. Permission is granted to use, distribute, and modify these resources.

Attribution is not required, but always appreciated--publicity is the best support.

Right now this project is not tied to anything official, so I would appreciate simply coming back later at future projects.

This project is directly inspired by Kenny’s Input Prompts. Xelu’s too. If you don’t like mine, check out theirs!
